2.5

Fixed default index finger curl weight to account for controllers without trigger touch.
Fixed an issue with grab point's that limited which hand could grab it would allow it anyway when there were multiple grab points in the same group.

Force Grabber:
	Any amount of grab points can be hit instead of one. If the grab point allows, the closest by position and rotation will be used.
	GrabPoser: Pose animated while an object is being force grabbed.
	HoverPoser: Pose animated while the force grabber is hovering over a grabbable.
	
Hand Grabber:
	ApplyHandLayer: optionally applies default hand layer on start, defaulted to true.
	GrabPoser: Pose animated while an object is being force grabbed.
	HoverPoser: Pose animated while hovering.
	New Grab(grabbable, grabTrigger, grabPoint) Method: For use with objects with poses assigned, will automatically bring the object to the correct orientation relative to the hand.

HVRJointSettings - Updated to allow Position, Rotation, or Position and Rotation drives to be assigned.
HVRPlayerController - Optional NeckPivot transform, if supplied will control HMD -> Player movement. Default rig updated with neck pivot camera child.
HVRTeleporter: New Teleport(position, direction) method to manually teleport the player in code, handling held objects and collision after. Demo scene updated with example usage.
HVRGrabbable - SocketGrabPoints field can be populated to limit what pose will be used, if empty all poses are valid.
HVRPosableHand and HVRPosableGrabPoint - added PoserIndex which will allow objects to have grab points that can be grabbed by different hand rigs.
HVRGrabPointSwapper - updated to handle multiple Posable Hand Indices.
HVRDamageHandler: Added HandleRayCastHit(HVRDamageProvider damageProvider, RaycastHit hit)
HVRCameraRig: Added SaveCalibrationHeight option that is useful for rapid debugging without having to manually calibrate in game.

Default hand strength has been adjusted to be more responsive, with a more realistic max force value.

HexaBody Integration - updated to match latest HexaBody asset update for hand responsiveness when turning.

Examples Updates:
	-TechDemoRig updated with force and hand grabber hover / grab poses.
	-Code driven grabbing of object which handles pose orientation and (mostly) post grab collision detection.
	-Code driven teleporting of player and held object to a position and facing specified direction.
	-Demo Weapons have had their grip hand strength settings removed and recoil values have been adjusted.
		Up Recoil position moved further forward to cause rotational torque instead of upward force.
	-HVRGrabbable SocketGrabPoints  example
	-Holster scale size set to 1.7
	FinalIK integration updated with animation legs from the latest FinalIK version.
	Added OpenXR Variant of the TechDemoRig with input system tracked drivers.
	Mjolnir has received a major buff.

2.4.6 Updates

New Example scene:
 Updated holsters which allow the knife / pistol in
 Added climbing, gun range, Auto collecting chest for socketables
 
Default poser hands updated to the new human hands.
HVRControllerOffset: Added Teleport transform field which you can supply the transform that is used to determine the teleport line direction. Rig prefabs updated. 
					 Grab point offsets will be inversely applied to the teleport transform so that holding a rotation offset grabpoint will no longer affect the teleport line direction.

2.4.5 <

Set execution order of the physics hands to be after the player controller to smooth out hand movements when starting and stopping quickly.
Fixed Hexa integration keyboard checks when using both input systems.
Revert changes caused by v1.1.1 of Unity input system update to mitigate compilation errors.
Reapply finger curls to all blend states if they are enabled.
Added support for Unity Input System keyboard / mouse debug buttons that were previously old input system only.
Player Controller initial HMD check is improved, optional param "InitialHMDAdjustment", and doesn't prevent the Update loop from executing if HMD is not detected.
Fixed HVRGrabPointSwapper for FinalIK, bad position offset while swapping, smoothed out rotation.
Fixed LineGrab hand rotation issue when LineInitialCanRotate was false.

Release 2.4

Fixed issue where FullStab would be invoked when the stabber was exiting the stabbable.
Stabber / Stabbable Stabbed event signature changed. 
Demo scene updated with stabbing system demonstration.
HexaBodyVR Integration updated with support for the new HexaBodyV4 release.


New HVRGrabPointSwapper - cycle through any number of defined grabpoints. Placed on HVRGrabbable object.	
	CombatKnife added to the new demo scene with this feature.

References to "WMRWithButtons" replaced with ReverbG2

HVRHandAnimator: 
	Completely reworked to allow smooth movement into and out of every pose. Speed is determined by the primary pose speed value.
	Float driven blend poses no longer smooth lerp, they take affect immediately. IE grip / trigger pull etc. 
	Eliminated GC allocation caused when swapping out hand poses.

Controller Offsets:
	Due to controller offsets not being consistent between Unity, SteamVR, and OpenXR a new Scriptable Object "HVRControllerOffsets" is added.
	Each major device has customizable position and rotation offsets per Input Plugin.
	HVRInputManager - Added "ControllerOffsets" field referencing the new SO. HVRGlobal prefab is updated with a default offset file.
	Offset fields have been removed from the HVRInputSettings scriptable object.
	Default OpenXR offsets are based on the Pointer / Aim poses.
	
Finger Curl Settings:
	The HVRFingerSettings Scriptable Object has been re-worked to have per finger weights for each of the capactive touch buttons as well as grip / trigger values.
	This will allow you to modify the influence of each button on each finger without having to make code changes.
	Knuckles finger tracking can optionally be ignored to use the Grip values like other controllers, useful for OpenXR as finger tracking is not yet implemented there.
	HVRGlobal prefab HVRInputManager component is updated with a new default reference.

Input Changes:
	Added GripForce to HVRController for Valve Knuckles which is populated from updated SteamVR and OpenXR bindings.
	HVRInputSettings / HVRController - updated to allow Grip and Trigger buttons to have an optional release threshold which can be greater or lower than the activation threshold.
	Knuckles SteamVR bindings are updated to read the Grip and GripForce values.
	Knuckles HVRInputSettings default Grip button setting has been changed to Analog with Threshold > .95 and Release < .6.

OpenXR Controller Setup:
	New HVRTrackedPoseDriver component, can be added to the controller transforms and will automatically make use of included controller pose bindings.
	


Release 2.31

Fixed HVRPhysicsButton sometimes having a non zero anchor.

HVRPosableGrabPoint:
	OneHandOnly - if true only one hand can hold the grab point 
	LineInitialCanReposition - if false the hand will grab where the pose is defined for line grabs
	LineInitialCanRotate - if false the hand will be oriented where the pose is defined for line grabs
	
Tech Demo Examples Scene:
	Added Grab Point Examples for Line Grab, OneHandOnly, Groups, LeftHand / RightHand only grabs, Hand rotation offset
	

Release 2.3

Fixed critical issue with teleporting where the left hand would move incorrectly.
Fixed backpack socket on new tech demo rig.
Fixed pose helper window for smaller screens by adding scrollview.
Fixed an issue where socketed objects with sockets would affect choosing a closer socket.
Fixed ammo count on HVRAmmo from not being public

Line Grabbing:
	Disabling LineCanRotate will now align the initial grab with the defined pose rotation in addition to preventing rotation when only holding trigger.
	Line Grabs no longer need to be aligned with the up vector of the physics hand, any orientation of the line is now allowed.
	Added LineFreeRotation (bool) to HVRPosableGrabPoint : if set to true the hand will always rotate freely about the defined line axis.

Socket Filter Updates:
	Added new Scriptable Object "HVRSocketableTags" - user can define up to 32 tags in this scriptable object without programming experience.
	Tags can be assigned to HVRTagSocketable and HVRTagSocketFilter which will cause a drop down to present itself for tag selection.
	Bitmasking is used to maintain efficient socket filtering.
	HVRSettings added "DefaultSocketableTags" - user can assign the default tag scriptable object that will auto populate in new filters / socketables when the component is added.
	New Demo Scenes updated to use this new tag filter system.

HVRSocketBag / HVRSocket - added DistanceSource transform field which allows users to override where distances checks are calculated from.
HVRInputModule : Added MaxDistance field which allows the UIPointer to only take affect within that distance to the canvas.
HVRHandGrabber:	New BreakDistanceReached event

HVRPosableGrabPoint: 
	Added Group field (int), grab points close to each other should assign to the same group, then pose rotation checks will be more effective
	on larger objects with multiple grab points that are further apart.


HexaBody Integration Player:
	Performed surgery on the shoulder transforms, should be in the right place now
	Fixed missing hand rigidbody references which are required to add the arm length limit joint
